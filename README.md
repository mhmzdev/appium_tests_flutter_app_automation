## Appium Test
This is a counter app for testing Appium with Flutter.

### üìú How to run
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhmzdev/appium_tests_flutter_app_automation.git
```
2. Navigate to `appium_test` directory
```bash
cd appium_test
```
3. Install node dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run Appium Server
```bash
appium
```
5. Run the test
```bash
npx wdio run wdio.android.js
```

| Do not use `sudo` when running POINT 4 and POINT 5, it will cause an error!

## Setup From Scratch
This is how you can setup everything from scratch for your own project.
### üéØ Setup Flutter
1. Add `flutter_driver` in your pubspec.yaml
```yaml
flutter_driver:
    sdk: flutter
```
2. Update `main.dart` to enable `flutter_driver`
```dart
import 'package:flutter_driver/driver_extension.dart';

void main() {
  enableFlutterDriverExtension();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
### üì¶ Build the app
1. Android app
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```
2. iOS app
```bash
flutter build ios --debug --simulator
```
### üß∞ Setup Appium
3. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
4. Create a node project
```
npm init -y
```
5. Install libraries
```
npm i -D @wdio/cli appium-flutter-finder appium-flutter-driver
```
6. Install the appium library in last, otherwise it causes conflicts if installed before:
```
npm i -D appium
```
| Add `sudo` if you are on macOS and you get an error.

Add this point the `package.json` should look like this:
```json
{
  "name": "app_appium_test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wdio/cli": "^9.5.7",
    "appium": "^2.15.0",
    "appium-flutter-driver": "^2.11.0",
    "appium-flutter-finder": "^0.2.0"
  }
}
```
7. Setup `wdio.conf.js` via WebDriverIO CLI
```bash
sudo npx wdio config
```
8 Complete the prompt as per your requirements, an example is like this:
```bash
‚úî A project named "app_appium_test" was detected at "/<Path-to-your-project>/appium_test", correct? yes
‚úî What type of testing would you like to do? E2E Testing - of Web or Mobile Applications

```
9 Once everything is done and successful, continue the setup for android or iOS via `appium-installer`
```bash
‚úî Continue with Appium setup using appium-installer (https://github.com/AppiumTestDistribution/appium-installer)? yes

10. Ultimately you'll be needing two files, `wdio.android.js` and `wdio.ios.js`
`wdio.android.js`:
```js
exports.config = {
    runner: 'local',
    path: '/wd/hub',
    port: 4723,
    specs: [
        './test/specs/**/*.js'
    ],
    exclude: [
    ],
    maxInstances: 10,
    capabilities: [{
        platformName: 'Android',
        'appium:deviceName': 'Pixel 4', // device name
        'appium:udid': 'emulator-5554', // generally it common for android emulators
        'appium:noReset': false,
        'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
        'appium:app': '<Path-to-your-project>/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk'
    }],
    logLevel: 'debug',
    bail: 0,
    waitforTimeout: 10000,
    connectionRetryTimeout: 120000,
    connectionRetryCount: 3,
    services: ['appium'],
    framework: 'mocha',
    reporters: ['spec'],
    mochaOpts: {
        ui: 'bdd',
        timeout: 60000
    },
}
```
`wdio.ios.js`:
```js
exports.config = {
    runner: 'local',
    path: '/wd/hub',
    port: 4723,
    specs: [
        './test/specs/**/*.js'
    ],
    exclude: [
    ],
    maxInstances: 10,
    capabilities: [{
        platformName: 'iOS',
        'appium:deviceName': 'iPhone 16 Pro', // device name
        'appium:platformVersion': '18.2', // device version
        'appium:udid': '<udid of your device>', // device udid get it via `xcrun simctl list`
        'appium:noReset': false,
        'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
        'appium:app': '<Path-to-your-project>/build/ios/iphonesimulator/Runner.app'
    }],
    logLevel: 'debug',
    bail: 0,
    waitforTimeout: 10000,
    connectionRetryTimeout: 120000,
    connectionRetryCount: 3,
    services: ['appium'],
    framework: 'mocha',
    reporters: ['spec'],
    mochaOpts: {
        ui: 'bdd',
        timeout: 60000
    },
}
```
### üß™ Run the test
1. Run Appium Server
```bash
appium
```
2. Run the test
```bash
npx wdio run wdio.android.js
```

NOTE: Do not use `sudo` when running the test, it will cause an error!
